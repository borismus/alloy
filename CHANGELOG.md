# Changelog

All notable changes to Alloy are documented here. The release workflow
publishes the section matching each version tag (e.g. `## 0.3.2`) as the body
of the corresponding GitHub release, so add a section here before bumping.

## 0.3.2

Fixes the in-app auto-updater, which was silently broken in 0.3.0 and 0.3.1 —
the bundled app never detected or applied updates.

⚠️ If you're on 0.3.0 or 0.3.1, you must update to 0.3.2 **manually this one
time**: download the app below and install over your current copy. Those
versions can't auto-update themselves. Once you're on 0.3.2, auto-updates work
normally again.

- Fix the auto-updater: the updater and process plugin shims were stubbed out
  for the bundled app once the build was unified in 0.3.0, so update checks
  always returned "none" and installs couldn't relaunch the app.
- Fix new conversations bouncing to the background view after the first reply.

## 0.3.1

- Notes: read-only viewer, external-editor editing, and full-text search.
