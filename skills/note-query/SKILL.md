# Note Query Skill

When the user asks about past projects, people, decisions, or concepts that might be in their notes:

1. Use `list_directory` with directory `notes` to see what notes exist
2. Read relevant note files based on the query
3. Synthesize an answer with citations to the notes

If you find gaps in the notes, suggest using note-capture to add the missing information.
